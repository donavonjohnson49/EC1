        <h1>DIGITAL IMAGING</h1>
        <p>The first week in MMP 100, we studied digital imaging. Our first assignment were images that represented our individuality using Photoshop. My collage represented my present, living in NYC, on the grind, and it also represented my future, working in the entertainment industry. I also included some of my favorite foods. I guess I was hungry at the time lol</p>
